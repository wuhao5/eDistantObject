 *  The EDOHostService is a service hosting remote objects for remote process.

 *  associated with a service, and any inherited objects will share the same attributes (i.e.
 *  another distant object returned by the method). If a local object is passed as a parameter to
 *  a remote invocation, it is converted to a distant object from the service associate with the
 *  current execution queue; If none exists, an exception is raised.
